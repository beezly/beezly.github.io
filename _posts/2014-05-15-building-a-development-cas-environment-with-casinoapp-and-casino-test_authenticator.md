Sometimes it's useful to be able to run a development CAS instance which allows you to
authenticate test users easily without createing lots of test accounts. I wrote 
[casino-test_authenticator](http://github.com/beezly/casino-test-authenticator) for exactly this purpose and you can get it running 2-3 minutes with [Casino](http://casino.rbcas.com/)

<!--more-->

First get a copy of CASinoApp

    git clone https://github.com/rbCAS/CASinoApp.git
    cd CASinoApp

Add the following to CasinoApp's Gemfile

    gem 'casino-test_authenticator'

Then configure config/cas.yml to include the test authenticator in the development environment

{% highlight yaml %}
development:
  frontend:
    sso_name: 'CASino'
    footer_text: 'Powered by <a href="http://rbcas.com/">CASino</a>'
  authenticators:
    test_authenticator:
      authenticator: "Test"
      options:
{% endhighlight %}

And configure the database in config/database.yml

{% highlight yaml %}
development:
  adapter: sqlite3
  database: db/development.sqlite3
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000
{% endhighlight %}
      
Get all the prerequisites installed

    bundle

Load the database

    bundle exec rake db:schema:load
    
And run the application

    rails s
    
Or use -p <port number> to run it on a different port (the default is 3000)
  
    rails s -p 9999
    
You should be able to access http://localhost:3000/ and log in when username==password
