Hashicorp [released Vault 0.10.4](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/hashicorp-announce/icgKzpswe-s) yesterday and one of the new features is a [plugin to support JWT/OIDC](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/jwt.html) as an auth method. Azure has an OIDC endpoint that you can use to authenticate against and if you are logged in with the Azure CLI tools you can easily get an access token with `az account get-access-token`. Here's how to get it working.

<!--more-->

First thing is to ensure you are running vault 0.10.4. Then enable the jwt auth method.

{% highlight sh %}
$ vault auth enable jwt
Success! Enabled jwt auth method at: jwt/
{% endhighlight %}

Then configure the JWT endpoint. Be sure to replace `{tenant_id}` with your Azure tenant ID.

{% highlight sh %}
$ vault write auth/jwt/config oidc_discovery_url='https://sts.windows.net/{tenant_id}/'
Success! Data written to: auth/jwt/config
{% endhighlight %}

Configure a role to log in as. The "audience" is dictated by what is provided by the Azure CLI. The "upn" claim is used by Vault to calculate an identity and Microsoft claim [it stores the User Principal Name](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-token-and-claims) of the authenticating user.

{% highlight sh %}
$ vault write auth/jwt/role/test-role policies='dev' bound_audiences='https://management.core.windows.net/' user_claim='upn'
Success! Data written to: auth/jwt/role/test-role
{% endhighlight %}

And that's it! In this example below, I get a vault token using the role created above and extract the token from the Azure CLI's output using [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).

{% highlight sh %}
$ vault write auth/jwt/login role=test-role jwt="$(az account get-access-token -o json | jq -r .accessToken)"
Key                  Value

token                4fa15547-ae06-ea74-5189-7eff73a06a0c

token_renewable      true
token_policies       ["default" "dev"]
identity_policies    []
policies             ["default" "dev"]
token_meta_role      test-role
